Presentación Alex Merchan

I'm Alex Merchan and I'm 17

I like the world of videogames and good music

Since a few months, I've been interested in japanese culture, and I'd like to make a trip to Japan with friends in the future

**At the moment I live with both of my parents and my sister**

``I'm also very interested in nature (not only plants but also any kind of animal)``

  I also like some animes. My top three are: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Boku no Hero and Kill la Kill
